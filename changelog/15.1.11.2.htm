<p>Dear fellow firewall enthusiasts,</p><p>Today's update includes a shiny new rewrite of the traffic shaper functionality for dummynet, another completed chapter in the ongoing quest for standardisation towards FreeBSD.  The other gem is the first batch of translations for Simplified Chinese kindly provided by two of our enthusiastic users from China.  We ask for you to try both features and let us know about limitations and issues through any of the usual channels.  We appreciate likes and don't-likes alike.  :)</p><p>Security-wise, it has been rather quiet.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
