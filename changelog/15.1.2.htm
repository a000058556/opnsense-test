<p>Hi folks,</p><p>Some of you have been wondering; now wonder no more: the next stable release is here.  From the changelog:</p><p><ul><li>firmware upgrade experience improvements</li><li>FreeBSD SA-15:01 with multiple OpenSSL fixes</li><li>OpenSSL from ports now brings you the latest and greatest 1.0.1l</li><li>pkg 1.4.6 hot off the press</li></ul></p><p>The images can be found here: <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/opnsense/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/opnsense/files/</a></p><p>This is mostly motivated by the latest OpenSSL issues, although I must say we work on giving LibreSSL a chance soon and make a final decision about the library that we are going to stick to from 15.7 on.  Any help here is appreciated. :)</p><p>Recommended ways of upgrade:</p><p>Upgrade via the GUI, make sure you restart the box so that no service will run on vulnerable binaries.  The base OpenSSL will *not* be updated at this point, so if you don't fully trust the port just yet try the second method.</p><p>Or:</p><p>Take your favourite image, boot up the device or VM with the new install image.  In the installer, choose "Import Configuration" and if all is well, continue with the Easy/Quick install.  This way makes sure all of the base system is replaced.</p>
