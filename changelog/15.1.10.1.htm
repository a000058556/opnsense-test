<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Here comes a quick hotfix for a pressing VLAN regression we've been hearing about today plus 3 more minor additions.  These are the patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>interfaces: fix interface rename regression that prevented VLANs from being set up</li><li>firmware: clean up downloaded packages after installation</li><li>logging: prevent spurious pgrep-related messages from being logged</li><li>config: fix Google Drive backup accounting off-by-two</li></ul></p><p>The update available via the GUI or console firmware upgrade.  No restarts necessary, except for those being affected by the VLAN regression.  Let us know whether this brings you back to normal.</p><p>Both LibreSSL and OpenSSL are available as of now!</p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
