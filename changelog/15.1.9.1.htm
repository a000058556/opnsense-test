Most notably, we've integrated DNS filtering via OpenDNS and tested / reworked the IPSec reporting.</p><p>As far as we know there have been no security-related fixes of bundled third-party software since 15.1.9.</p><p>Update through the GUI via "System: Firmware" or the root console option "12) Upgrade from console".
