<p>Good news everyone!</p><p>We hope you guys are having a good week?  Because if not we have a treat for you: the wait for System Health[<a target="_blank" href="https://opnsense.org/system-health-whats-next/">1</a>] is finally over and the best part is that it'll just work with your previously collected RRD data.  :) We kindly ask you to provide feedback via the usual channels in order to make it even better.  There's still a lot of time till 16.1 hits the shelves, so to speak.</p><p>This is a rather small maintenance release with a handful of fixes.  The things that pop out are StrongSwan 5.3.3[<a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Changelog53">2</a>] as well as the menu now being correctly translated when selecting a different language.  And, BTW, behind the scenes we're just now opening up our translation server that'll make it even easier to contribute to language translations in the future.</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>health: added feature to browse RRD data in a modern way</li><li>notable ports updates: strongswan 5.3.3</li><li>logs: added proxy server access log and updated the layout</li><li>users: fixed ldap import warning when no users could be found</li><li>dhcp6: fix IPv6 grabbing with PPPoE</li><li>openvpn: fix TLS auth enable behaviour in client settings</li><li>firewall: fix missing log option in save form</li><li>firewall: fix missing interface address in NAT page</li><li>firmware: sped up package queries and added package size column</li><li>wizard: multiple fixes and security improvements</li><li>menu: now properly translates into the selected language</li><li>traffic shaper: unload ipfw rules on disable</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
