<p>Hi all,</p><p>It is time for a last full stable release before we offer our 16.1.20 end-of-life version, which then can be used to upgrade to the 16.7 series.</p><p>Most changes presented today were either long-running development additions for 16.7 or small reports that came up during the 16.7-RC testing period.  Another prominent fix addresses an issue with sporadic premature captive portal authentication timeouts that one of our awesome forum members helped to debug.</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>ports: suricata 3.0.2[<a target="_blank" href="https://suricata-ids.org/2016/06/20/suricata-3-0-2-released/">1</a>], squid 3.5.20[<a target="_blank" href="https://suricata-ids.org/2016/06/20/suricata-3-0-2-released/">1</a>], expat 2.2.0[<a target="_blank" href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">3</a>], haproxy 1.6.7[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.6/src/CHANGELOG">4</a>], bind 9.10.4-P2[<a target="_blank" href="https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01396/81/BIND-9.10.4-P2-Release-Notes.html">5</a>]</li><li>firewall: hide previously selected nested aliases from the autocompletion on alias edit</li><li>firewall: fix log view to properly render all of its html</li><li>firewall: fix link to IPv6 disable setting on rules screen</li><li>firewall: remove CARP restriction of matching interface subnet</li><li>interfaces: fix IPv6 subnet bits count on interface status</li><li>interfaces: traffic graphs now show more device types</li><li>gateways: prevent spurious dynamic default gateways from showing up</li><li>gateways: change the creation order of dynamic gateways to allow overriding their settings correctly</li><li>firmware: refine ignore of temporary error 500 in GUI during upgrades</li><li>firmware: default config has been adapted to set up new style dashboard entries during e.g. factory reset</li><li>firmware: validate source and destination entries in NPT</li><li>firmware: audited mirror list and disabled non-working entries</li><li>services: do not show disabled DHCPv6 server when prefix delegation is not used</li><li>services: do not run boot-up routines for proxy server and intrusion detection when disabled</li><li>services: fix router advertisements subnet bits save</li><li>intrusion detection: improved alert browsing with action filter</li><li>proxy server: ACL setup can now include manual pre and post hooks</li><li>wizard: fixed alignment of page titles and contents</li><li>captive portal: ignore incomplete MAC entries to avoid premature logout of active user</li><li>openvpn: fix display of selected CRL in server settings</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
