<p>The OPNsense core team is proud to announce that it has released its 15.1 version, nicknamed "Ascending Albatross", of the open source OPNsense firewall software.</p><p>This is the first release by the OPNsense project.

Be sure to visit the project website[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.opnsense.org/">2</a>] and learn more about us and the project.  The project wants to be a friendly place for users, developers and partners.</p><p>We believe that an open source project should keep its sources and build tools available for all.

Developers are invited to check out our easy-to-use build tools. Commercial Support assists in keeping networks fast and secure.  The project welcomes partners to be successful together.</p><p>OPNsense(r) is based on FreeBSD 10 and is a fork of pfSense(r) which in its turn is a fork of m0n0wall(r).</p><p>The next major release is 15.7 and is to be released on July 1st 2015.  Bug fixes and security patches will be released when available.</p><p>We are looking forward to welcome you in the OPNsense community.</p><p>Because Open makes Sense!</p><p>The OPNsense core team</p>
