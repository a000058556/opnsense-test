<p>Hi there,</p><p>We pop in for a short stable update, namely 16.1.4.  Squid has been updated to 3.5.14 and received a GUI entry for maximum_object_size to define since the default has been reported as a wee bit too small.</p><p>In other news, the final roadmap for 16.7 will be unveiled later this week after much internal discussion.  Our main goals are to finish a full code audit, further alignment with FreeBSD and a few tiny surprises.  Stay tuned for those.  :)</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>ports: squid 3.5.14[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/SQUID_3_5_14.html">1</a>]</li><li>dhcp: fix menu expand with IPv6 configuration</li><li>captive portal: fix database timeout lock message</li><li>interfaces: fix expand/collapse on status page for Edge</li><li>proxy: add maximum_object_size setting for squid</li><li>load balancer: improve filter reload to prevent traffic lockout (contributed by Frank Wall)</li><li>layout: fix searchable dropdown truncation with IE</li><li>firewall: fix action buttons on alias edit</li><li>menu: updated help menu entries</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
