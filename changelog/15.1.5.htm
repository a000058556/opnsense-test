<p>Howdy everyone,</p><p>We shifted the release back a couple of days to discuss current progress and the feedback we've gotten and directly review the release process -- it seems to be "clean enough".  ;)</p><p>We've updated the bug trackers, added a couple of wiki pages and related articles with more on roadmap refinement on the way in a day or two.  Thank you for all the responses and kind mentions.</p><p>This is a typical maintenance release with ports stable updates and various core fixes.  On the other hand, we are putting a new MVC-based framework in place to slowly replace the current front end scripting (yep, this is a request for comments).  Here is the full list of changes:</p><p><ul><li>Removed a spurious user-agent check to restore mobile device support.</li><li>Fixed pop-up window handling for LDAP configuration.</li><li>Fixed several minor GUI bugs in firewall rules and system pages.</li><li>Grab the correct OpenSSL from the system for encrypting/decrypting the configuration files.</li><li>Message of the day now shows the correct system version.</li><li>Fixed sorting and button for deleting selected rules in NAT pages.</li><li>Notable ports updates: pkg 1.4.10, gettext 0.19.4, libzmq 4.0.5, ntp 4.2.8p1, ca_root_nss 3.17.4, libsodium 1.0.2</li><li>Groundwork on the MVC-based GUI replacement including examples.  This does not affect the current GUI.</li></ul></p><p>All upgrade methods are viable.
