<p>Hi there,</p><p>Time for the weekly update.  :)</p><p>15.7.19 is a smaller maintenance release with a backend switch for IPsec reporting and a couple of minor fixes.  With the help of the community, we're also improving the consistency of the GUI translation with more commits already in the works.</p><p>Notable from a development version perspective are the API authentication and the revived voucher support for our new captive portal.  This means two more roadmap items already finished for 16.1.</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>ports: sudo 1.8.15[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sudo.ws/legacy.html#1.8.15">1</a>], sqlite 3.9.2[<a target="_blank" href="https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_9_2.html">2</a>]</li><li>aliases: make url tables useable</li><li>interfaces: fix faulty GUI caching issues[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues/451">3</a>]</li><li>ipsec: obey force nat traversal</li><li>ipsec: switch status page and widget from deprecated SMP to VICI interface for reliable output</li><li>ipsec: fixed remote network input validation</li><li>status: show more raw ipfw info in the commands section</li><li>config: don't use notices in early/low level code</li><li>languages: a large number of old and new strings is now being properly translated (with contributions from Franz Fabian and Frederic Lietart)</li><li>languages: translation strings no longer use obfuscated argument reordering by default</li><li>languages: updated German and French to a newer version from translate.opnsense.org</li><li>captive portal (development): added a new voucher implementation</li><li>api (development): added API key authentication mechanism[<a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.opnsense.org/index.php/Howto_use_the_API">4</a>]</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
