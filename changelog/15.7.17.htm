<p>Good day to you all,</p><p>So this is 15.7.17 with a couple of neat things under the hood: AES-NI is now supported by both LibreSSL and OpenSSL.  Other than that only minor fixes went in along with the latest version bumps for cURL, Squid, Unbound and (of course) LibreSSL.</p><p>The development version has more things happening: we've reorganised the menu to get rid of the "Status" and "Diagnostics" section, updating layouts and minimising padding of the bootstrap theme.  And that's not all, because we're also replacing the old captive portal!  The new captive portal can already be tested and will receive more features as we near version 16.1.  Let us know what you think.</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>ports: both LibreSSL and OpenSSL now support AES-NI acceleration</li><li>ports: curl 7.45[<a target="_blank" href="https://curl.haxx.se/changes.html">1</a>], squid 3.5.10[<a target="_blank" href="http://ftp.meisei-u.ac.jp/mirror/squid/squid-3.5-ChangeLog.txt">2</a>], unbound 1.5.5[<a target="_blank" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/download/">3</a>], libressl 2.2.4[<a target="_blank" href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/5.8/common/007_obj2txt.patch.sig">4</a>]</li><li>layout: bumped font awesome to 4.4</li><li>dhcp: dhcpd leases did not always reload dhcpleases daemon</li><li>openvpn: fix Strict User/CN matching checkbox behaviour</li><li>ipsec: fix tunnel identification when using NAT</li><li>dns filter: add OpenDNS IPv6 servers</li><li>dns resolver: fix apply glitch that would blank the settings temporarily</li><li>log files: search is now case-insensitive</li><li>firmware: improved reboot detection feedback</li><li>crash reporter: improved wording as reports without contact info may be hard to fix</li><li>virtual ip: fix possible apply glitch with new VIP</li><li>synchronisation: do not error on target down, log it instead</li><li>languages: French is at 35% and German is at 65% complete now</li><li>development: the captive portal has been replaced with a newly implemented variant based on our MVC standards -- if you still want to use the old one please use the release package instead (although any feedback for the new captive portal is greatly appreciated)</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
