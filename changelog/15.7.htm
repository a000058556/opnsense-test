<p>A good evening to you all,</p><p>While the summer is hot, we push forward to what now is 15.7 -- nicknamed 'Brave Badger' -- right in front of you.  A lot of effort went into this project during the past 6 months, and we dare say it has been worth all of it.  We would like to thank our followers and friends and feedback givers and forum lurkers and contributors and doubters and supporters that helped to make 15.7 what it is.  We wouldn't be here without any of you. Thank you.</p><p>In itself, 15.7 is a simple upgrade from 15.1.12 which we recommend to everyone.  What changes is that development will move to a different branch so that from now on regressions are less likely and therefore stability will increase further.  The provided images may also be the only ones for the next 6 months as we are confident in their longevity and the online upgrade path.  We have also bumped the LibreSSL flavour to a production-ready state and encourage everyone to try it out.  The installer's import configuration tool coupled with a quick and easy installation can help you move from OpenSSL to LibreSSL and back seamlessly.</p><p>The biggest addition is the intrusion detection integration (suricata) as well as new local and remote blacklists options for the proxy server (squid). Security-wise, it has been rather quiet with only a few CVEs in third-party tools.
