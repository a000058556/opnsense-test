<p>Hello, hello!</p><p>For more than two and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.</p><p>We are writing to you today to announce the second release candidate for version 17.7, which, over the course of the last 5 months, includes highlights such as SafeStack application hardening, the Realtek re(4) driver for network stability, a Quagga plugin with broad routing protocol support and the Unbound resolver as the new default.  Additionally, translations for Czech, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and German have been completed during this iteration.</p><p>Focus in OPNsense has shifted to improving and streamlining its various systems and providing continuous updates, which amounts to over 300 individual changes made since 17.1 so far.  The plugin infrastructure is growing as well thanks to our awesome contributors Frank Wall, Frank Brendel, Fabian Franz and Michael Muenz.  And we, last but not least, have been working more closely than ever with HardenedBSD by unifying our ports infrastructure.  Although this is only the beginning, let us not skip ahead.</p><p>Here is the full list of changes against version 17.7-RC1:</p><p><ul><li>system: harden GUI by removing TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA</li><li>system: harden GUI by improving Secure Attribute cookie usage</li><li>system: harden GUI by using DH-4096 parameters</li><li>system: regenerate Diffie-Hellman parameters</li><li>system: allow to reverse password / token order in TOTP authentication</li><li>system: added major GUI firmware upgrade code</li><li>interfaces: fix WLAN device clone creation</li><li>interfaces: improve LAGG MTU handling and reconfigure</li><li>interfaces: Host-Uniq configuration option for PPPoE connections</li><li>ipsec: IKEv2 can handle multiple phase 1 with the same IP</li><li>installer: request password change after installation</li><li>installer: now properly advertises itself as version 17.7</li><li>rc: batch-run bootup command before starting services</li><li>openvpn: normalise line endings like web GUI does</li><li>openvpn: fix config read/write on PHP 7.1</li><li>mvc: squelch a PHP notice on an undefined element in forms (contributed by Evgeny Bevz)</li><li>lang: update Chinese, Czech, German, Japanese</li><li>plugins: enable stable plugins for 17.7</li><li>plugins: os-dyndns 1.1 fixes menu entry visibility</li><li>plugins: os-quagga 1.3.2 (contributed by Fabian Franz and Michael Muenz)</li><li>ports: php 7.0.21[<a target="_blank" href="https://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.0.21">1</a>]</li><li>ports: perl 5.24.2[<a target="_blank" href="https://perldoc.perl.org/5.24.2/perldelta">2</a>]</li><li>ports: suricata 3.2.3[<a target="_blank" href="https://suricata-ids.org/2017/07/13/suricata-3-2-3-available/">3</a>]</li><li>ports: unbound 1.6.4[<a target="_blank" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/download/">4</a>]</li></ul></p><p>The list of currently known issues with 17.7-RC2:</p><p><ul><li>LAGG device destroy may cause a kernel panic.
