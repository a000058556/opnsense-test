<p>Dear friends and followers,</p><p>It pleases us to say that although we ship the latest OpenSSL 1.0.2g today, we have had both SSv2 and SSv3 support disabled in our installation for a long while, so older installations are also not affected by yesterday's announcement.  On a slightly related note, LibreSSL was not affected at all.</p><p>With that out of the way, we also happily let you know that we are shipping RFC 4638 support with this stable release.  We also push a fix for an upstream bug in Unbound and update Squid to the latest version... again. ;)</p><p>We have also announced the roadmap for 16.7.  Take a look at our upcoming milestones:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/">https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/</a></p><p>And now, here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>ports: squid 3.5.15[<a target="_blank" href="http://ftp.meisei-u.ac.jp/mirror/squid/squid-3.5-ChangeLog.txt">1</a>], unbound 1.5.7 hotfix[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/bugs-script/show_bug.cgi?id=729">2</a>], pkg 1.6.4 hotfix[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/1394">3</a>], openssl 1.0.2g[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160301.txt">4</a>]</li><li>services: infrastructure rework for plugin additions</li><li>openvpn: added copy/move to client-specific overrides</li><li>openvpn: allow binding client-specific overrides to specific server(s)</li><li>openvpn: service on/off toggle via overview pages</li><li>openvpn: fix problem with service status display</li><li>openvpn: when services are disabled, make sure a reconfigure will always stop the associated process</li><li>vpn: transform PPTP, L2TP and PPPoE servers to plugin addition to be removed from base install for 16.7</li><li>vpn: add proper service probing for PPTP, L2TP and PPPoE servers</li><li>interfaces: added RFC 4638 support (MTU &gt; 1492 in PPPoE)</li><li>ntp: disable when no servers are set</li><li>language: updates for Chinese, French and German</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
