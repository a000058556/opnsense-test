<p>Hi guys,</p><p>It is update time!  This time around, DHCP and DNS have been freshened up thoroughly, removing both potential and real problems from the GUI and underneath.  Additionally, the proxy server gained ICAP support and a category-based remote block list selection.</p><p>Our firmware mirror support has finally been extended so that it is now possible to pull all updates from a single mirror, which will very soon make it possible to run a local mirror for your internal installations. We are also shipping the original FreeBSD OpenSSL patch, although the security issues cannot not surface on OPNsense.  We just like to be thorough.</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>src: Fix multiple vulnerabilities of OpenSSL[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/7d8d4cb5">1</a>]</li><li>src: update tzdata to 2016a[<a target="_blank" href="http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz-announce/2016-January/000035.html">2</a>]</li><li>ports: openssh 7.2p1[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.2">3</a>], isc-dhcp-43 4.3.3P1_1[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-dhcp-4-3-0-is-live/">4</a>], php 5.6.19[<a target="_blank" href="https://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.6.19">5</a>], curl 7.41.1[<a target="_blank" href="https://curl.haxx.se/changes.html">6</a>]</li><li>firmware: mirror selection has been widened to include kernel/base upgrades</li><li>firmware: bootstrap utility can now directly install e.g. the development version</li><li>dhcp: all GUI pages have been reworked for a polished look and feel</li><li>proxy: added category-based remote file support if compressed file contains multiple files</li><li>proxy: added ICAP support (contributed by Fabian Franz)</li><li>proxy: hook up the transparent FTP proxy</li><li>proxy: add intercept on IPv6 for FTP and HTTP proxy options</li><li>logging: syslog facilities, like services, are now fully pluggable</li><li>vpn: stripped an invalid PPTP server configuration from the standard configuration</li><li>vpn: converted to pluggable syslog, menu and ACL</li><li>dyndns: all GUI pages have been reworked for a polished look and feel</li><li>dyndns: widget now shows IPv6 entries too</li><li>dns forwarder: all GUI pages have been reworked for a polished look and feel</li><li>dns resolver: all GUI pages have been reworked for a polished look and feel</li><li>dns resolver: rewrote the dhcp lease registration hooks</li><li>dns resolver: allow parallel operation on non-standard port when dns forwarder is running as well</li><li>firewall: hide outbound nat rule input for "interface address" option and toggle bitmask correctly</li><li>interfaces: fix problem when VLAN tags weren't generated properly</li><li>interfaces: improve interface capability reconfigure</li><li>ipsec: fix service restart behaviour from GUI</li><li>captive portal: add missing chain in certificate generation</li><li>configd: improve recovery and reload behaviour</li><li>load balancer: reordered menu entries for clarity</li><li>ntp: reordered menu entries for clarity</li><li>traffic shaper: fix mismatch for direction + dual interfaces setup</li><li>languages: updated German and French</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
