<p>Good news everyone,</p><p>It is time for a smaller update to 16.1.3.  There is another fix for our Hyper-V users, the health section finally received its CPU temperature graph and a few ports have been updated to their latest version.  Nothing of particular interest happened, no issues with glibc from our side today.  :)</p><p>A number of assorted issues have been flushed from the code thanks to good use of the crash reporter.  A special thank you goes to those of you who submit email addresses and a brief description along with the report.  For us it is tremendously useful to get as many details as possible and to verify that our fixed work reliably in a particular use cases before shipping them.</p><p>Enough with the announcing already, here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>src: hyperv/kvp: wake up the daemon if it is sleeping due to poll()[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues/748">1</a>]</li><li>src: Use correct src/dst ports when removing states in pf[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/src/pull/9">2</a>]</li><li>src: finish the boot loader branding by adding a shiny logo</li><li>ports: unbound 1.5.7[<a target="_blank" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/download/#unbound-1-5-7">3</a>], openldap 2.4.44[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.openldap.org/software/release/changes.html">4</a>], ca_root_nss 3.22, php 5.7.18[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.6.18">5</a>], phalcon 2.0.10[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/phalcon-v2.0.10">6</a>], pkg 1.6.4[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/commit/364bf01c846">7</a>][<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/commit/69fe3e55ff5">8</a>]</li><li>interfaces: collapsible overview for each interface</li><li>shaper: fix issue with model when not able to save an old config</li><li>health: added pages to ACL for configurable user access</li><li>health: record system CPU temperature in additional graph</li><li>firmware: add UK-based mirror (contributed by Will Jones)</li><li>access: force a visible and non-critical page on non-access redirect</li><li>access: make sure "/" is handled like "/index.php"</li><li>configuration: add a number of previously missing config sections for selection on restore/backup</li><li>firewall: bring back alias nesting</li><li>dhcp: add missing DNS resolver awareness</li><li>dhcp: fix multiple minor crash reports</li><li>radvd: add missing DNS resolver awareness</li><li>captive portal: ensure MAC address is saved in lowercase and improve validation</li><li>captive portal: fix unicode issue in template generation</li><li>captive portal: correct syslog redirection regression</li><li>crash reporter: limit log size upload to 1MB</li><li>cron: fix validation of hour value</li><li>intrusion detection: show origin link of rule sets in details</li><li>services: add background daemon to known services for easy reload</li><li>services: add captive portal to known services for easy reload</li><li>services: improve redirect on service reload in diagnostics page</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
